### WELCOME TO THE KINGDOM ðŸ‘‘

### Hello my name is Domenik Moody, but you can call me Dom

Im an enthusiastic full-stack software engineer with a deep passion for art, music, and Dad Jokes. Before embarking on my software engineering journey, I had the opportunity to work in the tech industry, providing technical support to users, and also gained experience in the financial industry as a banker. These roles helped me realize my true calling and led me to pursue education at App Academy, where I dedicated myself to studying and gaining over 1000 hours of hands-on coding experience.

During my time at App Academy, I not only honed my technical skills but also received invaluable mentorship from experienced developers, which further fueled my passion for software engineering. I had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge and creativity to real-world scenarios. Some of my notable projects include:

  [OtakuXpress](https://otakuxpress.onrender.com/)

  [AudioDome](https://audiodome.onrender.com/)

  [Paradise Abode](https://api-project-base.onrender.com/)
  
</div>

These projects, have allowed me to showcase my range of programming languages and frameworks (Python, JavaScript, Express, SQL, Sequelize, SQLite, Flask, React, Redux, and SQLAlchemy) while incorporating my love for art, music, and humor. I thrive on the opportunity to merge my diverse background with my software engineering skills to create innovative and enjoyable experiences for users.
